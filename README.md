RupiSight was developed as part of my Final Project (known as Tugas Besar in Indonesia) to fulfill the graduation requirements for my undergraduate degree. By using the phoneâ€™s camera and advanced image recognition technology, the app can detect and announces the denomination of banknotes, helping users manage their finances with ease and independence.

The app integrates accessibility features such as voice guidance, enabling users to hear the detected banknote value aloud. Whether shopping or receiving cash, RupiSight ensures that visually impaired individuals can confidently and efficiently identify their money, promoting greater financial inclusion.

Key Features:

1. Real-time banknote detection using the phone's camera.

2. Voice feedback for easy identification.

3. Support only for Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) denominations. Released between ~2000-2016.
